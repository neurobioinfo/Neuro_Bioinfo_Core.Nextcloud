# Getting Started on the Neuro_Bioinfo_Core Nextcloud Server

## New groups
If you are a PI and wish to begin storing your data on the Neuro_Bioinfo_Core storage platform, please follow these steps:
1. Contact neurobioinfo@mcgill.ca and let us know. An admin will create your group and all necessary folders on the nextcloud server.
2. You will be notified as soon as your group has been created, and given the initial username and password for your group admin user.
> You can change this password after your first login
3. Optionally, we can create any number of additional users when we create your group. For each additional user you will need to provide us:  
* The user's full name  
* The user's email address  
* Whether any storage quotas should be applied to this user (default: no)
* Whether or not the user should have group admin privileges (default: no)  
&nbsp;  
Alternately, you can create your own users following the instructions below.

## New users
By default the first user created for a new group will be the group admin.  
This should be the group PI, though of course PIs are at their discretion to delegate this job behind the scenes to another member of their lab.  

Group admins can easily create new users for their groups on Nextcloud via the following steps:
1. Click on your user icon in the top-right of the screen and select "Users" from the drop-menu
2. Click the "New User" button on the left side pannel
3. Fill in the form that pops up with the relevant info. 
* Be sure to add the user to your group!
* You will have to set an initial password for new users. The user can later change the password to one of their choosing

## Creating additional Nextcloud Groups under the same PI
By default, PIs will be assigned only a single nextcloud group.  
Only system admins can create new groups. If you would like to create another, please contact neurobioinfo@mcgill.ca to discuss your needs.
